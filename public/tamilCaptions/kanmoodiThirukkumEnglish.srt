1
00:00:26,84 --> 00:00:31,59
When I opened my eyes like god appearing before me,

2
00:00:31,60 --> 00:00:36,83
She appeared before my eyes.

3
00:00:36,83 --> 00:00:42,00
Like caught in a heavy downpour without an umbrella,

4
00:00:42,00 --> 00:00:46,56
You drenched me in the rain of love.

5
00:00:46,56 --> 00:00:51,71
Till I met you, All my days were listless.

6
00:00:51,71 --> 00:00:56,54
After meeting her all days have become festivals.

7
00:00:56,54 --> 00:01:02,04
I’ve got involved in a beautiful accident.

8
00:01:02,04 --> 00:01:06,85
Though there were ways to escape, I willingly gave it up.

9
00:01:06,85 --> 00:01:10,49
Oho..hoo…oho..hoo..ooh…o

10
00:01:10,49 --> 00:01:17,00
ho..ooo..ooo..whoo..whoo

11
00:01:17,00 --> 00:01:37,21
Whistle:...

12
00:01:37,21 --> 00:02:12,62
Music...

13
00:02:12,62 --> 00:02:18,14
I don’t know your name. I don’t know your place.

14
00:02:18,00 --> 00:02:22,79
A beautiful bird doesn’t need a name.

15
00:02:22,79 --> 00:02:28,12
I’m looking at you without you realizing.

16
00:02:28,12 --> 00:02:32,74
Can the moon know the image on the river water?

17
00:02:32,74 --> 00:02:43,23
I’m carrying a life inside my life Is this what you call love?

18
00:02:43,23 --> 00:02:48,24
The burden on my heart...,

19
00:02:48,24 --> 00:02:52,74
Is it love for you?

20
00:02:52,74 --> 00:02:58,32
When I opened my eyes as a god appearing before me,

21
00:02:58,32 --> 00:03:03,07
She appeared before my eyes

22
00:03:03,07 --> 00:03:36,10
Music...

23
00:03:36,10 --> 00:03:38,02
If you step on the road,

24
00:03:38,02 --> 00:03:41,60
even street lights will wink at you.

25 
00:03:41,60 --> 00:03:46,34
Even Sun will refuse to set.

26
00:03:46,34 --> 00:03:51,00
if you bathe in the river, even fish will get the fever.

27
00:03:51,00 --> 00:03:55,67
Rain will rush down to touch you.

28
00:03:55,67 --> 00:04:01,54
Even if an earthquake comes..

29
00:04:01,54 --> 00:04:06,60
It can’t break my strong heart.

30
00:04:06,60 --> 00:04:16,24
When a flower struck me, it gave in easily.

31
00:04:16,24 --> 00:04:22,04
When I opened my eyes as a god appearing before me,

32
00:04:22,04 --> 00:04:26,72
She appeared in front of my eyes.

33
00:04:26,72 --> 00:04:31,83
Like caught in a heavy rainstorm without an umbrella,

34
00:04:31,83 --> 00:04:37,39
You’ve soaked me in the rain of love.

35
00:04:37,39 --> 00:05:00,00
Ooh ..ooh..oooo..oooo..ooh…ohoo..ooh…ooh…ooo..ooo…hoo…oho
