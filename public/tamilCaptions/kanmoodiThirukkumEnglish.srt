1
00:00:27,00 --> 00:00:31,00
When I opened my eyes like god appearing before me,

2
00:00:31,00 --> 00:00:36,00
She appeared before my eyes.

3
00:00:36,00 --> 00:00:42,00
Like caught in a heavy downpour without an umbrella,

4
00:00:42,00 --> 00:00:46,00
You drenched me in the rain of love.

5
00:00:46,00 --> 00:00:51,00
Till I met you, All my days were listless.

6
00:00:51,00 --> 00:00:57,00
After meeting her all days have become festivals.

7
00:00:57,00 --> 00:01:02,00
I’ve got involved in a beautiful accident.

8
00:01:02,00 --> 00:01:07,00
Though there were ways to escape, I willingly gave it up.

9
00:01:07,00 --> 00:01:11,00
Oho..hoo…oho..hoo..ooh…o

10
00:01:11,00 --> 00:01:17,00
ho..ooo..ooo..whoo..whoo

11
00:01:17,00 --> 00:01:37,00
Whistle:...

12
00:01:37,00 --> 00:02:12,00
Music...

13
00:02:12,00 --> 00:02:18,00
I don’t know your name. I don’t know your place.

14
00:02:18,00 --> 00:02:22,00
A beautiful bird doesn’t need a name.

15
00:02:22,00 --> 00:02:28,00
I’m looking at you without you realizing.

16
00:02:28,00 --> 00:02:32,00
Can the moon know the image on the river water?

17
00:02:32,00 --> 00:02:41,00
I’m carrying a life inside my life Is this what you call love?

18
00:02:43,00 --> 00:02:47,00
The burden on my heart...,

19
00:02:47,00 --> 00:02:52,00
Is it love for you?

20
00:02:52,00 --> 00:02:59,00
When I opened my eyes as a god appearing before me,

21
00:02:59,00 --> 00:03:03,00
She appeared before my eyes

22
00:03:03,00 --> 00:03:36,00
Music...

23
00:03:36,00 --> 00:03:38,00
If you step on the road,

24
00:03:38,00 --> 00:03:41,00
even street lights will wink at you.

25 
00:03:41,00 --> 00:03:46,00
Even Sun will refuse to set.

26
00:03:47,00 --> 00:03:50,00
if you bathe in the river, even fish will get the fever.

27
00:03:51,00 --> 00:03:56,00
Rain will rush down to touch you.

28
00:03:56,00 --> 00:04:02,00
Even if an earthquake comes..

29
00:04:02,00 --> 00:04:05,00
It can’t break my strong heart.

30
00:04:06,00 --> 00:04:16,00
When a flower struck me, it gave in easily.

31
00:04:17,00 --> 00:04:21,00
When I opened my eyes as a god appearing before me,

32
00:04:22,00 --> 00:04:26,00
She appeared in front of my eyes.

33
00:04:27,00 --> 00:04:31,00
Like caught in a heavy rainstorm without an umbrella,

34
00:04:32,00 --> 00:04:36,00
You’ve soaked me in the rain of love.

35
00:04:36,00 --> 00:05:00,00
Ooh ..ooh..oooo..oooo..ooh…ohoo..ooh…ooh…ooo..ooo…hoo…oho
